# Architecture Decision Records

Owner decisions for the omp harness, one file per decision. Each record states the forces that
made the decision necessary, the decision itself, and what it commits the codebase to. Records are
append-only: a superseded decision gets a new record and a `Superseded by` line, never an edit that
rewrites history.

Source: most records distil "The Harness Playbook" (blog, 2026-09-02) and cross-reference the crates
that implement them. `AGENTS.md` "Locked Deviations from pi" is the enforcement summary; these
records are the reasoning behind it.

## Format

```
# NNNN. Title

Status: accepted | proposed | superseded by NNNN
Date: YYYY-MM-DD
Area: foundations | state | runtime | control-plane | inference | tools | interface | stack

## Context      — the forces, with evidence (what broke in omp v1 / pi, measurements)
## Decision     — what we do, stated as rules; call sites / shapes where useful
## Consequences — what becomes easy, what becomes prohibited, costs accepted
## Status in omp — crates/files implementing it; gaps marked plainly
## References   — related records, code, external prior art
```

Rules: `Decision` is normative (MUST/NEVER); `Context` is evidence, not opinion; `Status in omp`
names real paths and says "not yet implemented" where true.

## Index

### Foundations
- [0001](0001-design-envelope.md) — Four operating modes are the architecture tests
- [0002](0002-complexity-has-one-owner.md) — Push hard problems down into the engine

### State
- [0003](0003-one-authoritative-session-tree.md) — One authoritative session tree; the journal is its patch stream
- [0004](0004-lifecycle-derives-from-the-tree.md) — Rewind, fork, resume, replication, and prompts derive from the tree
- [0005](0005-controller-actor-separation.md) — Controller owns state; views are projections

- [0038](0038-journal-physical-integrity.md) — Physical integrity is distinct from journal authority

### Runtime
- [0006](0006-host-policy-sandbox-stub.md) — Policy on the trusted host; an obedient bounded stub in the sandbox
- [0007](0007-subagent-filesystem-isolation.md) — Subagents get a copy-on-write view and return a diff
- [0008](0008-tool-execution-is-a-state-stream.md) — A tool call is one element whose state streams; no three-callback contract
- [0009](0009-bound-output-once.md) — Output is bounded centrally; full results become artifacts
- [0010](0010-one-job-primitive.md) — One job primitive for tools, subagents, daemons, and background work
- [0011](0011-cancellation-needs-a-kill-boundary.md) — Cancellation is a runtime guarantee, not cooperative etiquette

### Control plane
- [0012](0012-convars.md) — Settings are convars: policy declared with the variable
- [0013](0013-inheritance-by-seeding-and-cfg.md) — Children seed from the parent; cfg files, not per-setting inherit flags
- [0014](0014-command-stream-binds-and-aliases.md) — Binds, toggles, aliases, and profiles ride the command stream
- [0015](0015-directors.md) — Directors own candidate yields
- [0016](0016-semantic-requests-cross-layers.md) — Directors state intent; inference chooses how to satisfy it

### Inference
- [0017](0017-compatibility-as-structured-knowledge.md) — Model compatibility is compiled knowledge with explicit precedence
- [0018](0018-provider-is-more-than-stream.md) — A provider is shared infrastructure, not a `stream` function
- [0019](0019-forced-tool-call-escalation.md) — Forced tool calls escalate: soft prompt, free flag, then costly flag
- [0020](0020-charitable-argument-repair.md) — Validate the contract strictly, repair the model's dialect charitably
- [0021](0021-constrained-sampling-ownership.md) — Inference owns strict-schema budgets and grammar dialects
- [0022](0022-corrective-inference.md) — An adapter is complete when it yields one canonical turn
- [0023](0023-tiny-local-model.md) — An embedded tiny model handles harness chores

### Tool surface
- [0024](0024-small-permanent-roster.md) — Every permanent tool taxes every turn; the roster stays small and fixed
- [0025](0025-long-tail-behind-stable-surfaces.md) — `dyn` and code surfaces carry the long tail
- [0026](0026-intent-and-versioned-tools.md) — Every tool carries `i`; every tool is versioned
- [0027](0027-read-materializes-resources.md) — `Read` materializes any resource; internal URL schemes
- [0028](0028-bash-is-an-in-process-interpreter.md) — `Bash` is a policy-aware in-process interpreter
- [0029](0029-autoqa-report-issue.md) — Agents get a bug-report path

### Interface
- [0030](0030-one-pass-rendering-pipeline.md) — RichText streams through one pass; no `string[]` render
- [0031](0031-typed-component-model.md) — Typed `(Element, Props, Children)` markup for every surface
- [0032](0032-presentation-policy-in-the-renderer.md) — Semantic colors, icons, charset, pacing belong to the renderer
- [0033](0033-verification-is-part-of-the-interface.md) — A debug protocol defines what the UI is
- [0034](0034-transcript-is-a-protocol.md) — Blocks, exactly-once history, append-only scrollback; TLA+-checked

### Stack
- [0035](0035-rust-for-the-engine.md) — Language choice is architecture; Rust for the engine
- [0036](0036-python-for-extensions.md) — Embedded Python for extensions, `@remote`, and `Eval`
