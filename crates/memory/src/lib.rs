//! Durable, default-off Mnemopi memory runtime.
//!
//! The crate never discovers Git roots or reads application settings directly.
//! The Environment supplies canonical repository identity and the app composes
//! the selected backend. Durable SQLite rows are authoritative; all recall
//! indexes are rebuildable.
