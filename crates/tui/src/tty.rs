//! Terminal device resolution honoring the `OMP_TTY` override.
//!
//! The UI talks to the controlling terminal directly (`/dev/tty` on Unix), so
//! a harness that only owns the process's pipes cannot observe or drive it.
//! Setting `OMP_TTY` to an alternate terminal device — typically a pty slave
//! whose master the harness holds — reroutes every terminal open (input,
//! output via [`TtyOut`], capability probes) and the terminal identity to
//! that device, delivering the complete byte stream a real terminal would
//! see on the master side.
//!
//! Limitations under an override: `SIGWINCH` is only delivered for the
//! controlling terminal, so live resizes will not propagate unless the
//! terminal supports in-band resize; set the window size up front with
//! `TIOCSWINSZ` on the master.
