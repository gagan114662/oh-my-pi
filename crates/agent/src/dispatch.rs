//! Whole-lifetime tool dispatch and central execution policy.
//!
//! A call is *prepared* the moment the provider names it (ADR 0008: the
//! executor consumes argument streaming live), *committed* when its canonical
//! arguments settle, and *driven* by one multiplexed loop that journals every
//! event of every call in a batch. Independent read-only calls run
//! concurrently; a mutating call is exclusive within its batch. Every call
//! settles through exactly one path: a typed terminal, a harness abort, or
//! detachment into the job primitive (ADR 0010) when it outlives the central
//! blocking limit.
