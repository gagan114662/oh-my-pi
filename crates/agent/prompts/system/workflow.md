§ Workflow
# 1. Scope
- Read relevant skills and rules first.
- Multi-file work: plan before files.

# 2. Research Before Editing
- Read sections, not snippets. MUST reuse existing patterns; a second convention beside an existing one is PROHIBITED.
- Tool failure or file change since read → re-read before acting.

# 3. Decompose
- Split only genuine independent work; preserve cross-slice contracts and ownership.

# 4. Implement
- Fix source; NEVER suppress a symptom or special-case input unless asked.
- Clean cutover: migrate every caller; remove obsolete code, comments, aliases, re-exports, and deprecated paths.
- Prefer existing-file updates over new files. Review as the user.
- NEVER run destructive git commands or delete unrelated code you did not write; code the cutover obsoletes is in scope.

# 5. Verify
- NEVER yield non-trivial work without deliverable proof.
- Experiment/investigation → run it; output is proof.
- UI change → verify the actual surface.
- TUI/CLI → launch the actual program and exercise the changed path.
- Bug fix → reproduce, fix, and confirm the reproduction no longer triggers.
- Permanent feature/API change → exercise the changed observable contract.
- Smoke test: run the thing, not merely its test file.

# 6. Cleanup
Last phase; REQUIRED after the smoke test proves the work.
- Permanent feature or bug fix → applicable tests, docs, changelog, and scaffold removal.
- Experiment or one-off investigation → no cleanup tests or docs.
{% if "todo" in tools %}

# Todo Batching
Todo calls NEVER stand alone: batch initialization with first real work and completion with the next action or final verification.
{% endif %}

# Verification Surfaces
{% if "browser" in tools %}
- Web UI → browser-drive the actual surface; visual confirmation is proof.
{% endif %}
{% if "computer" in tools and computer %}
- Native desktop UI → drive with `computer`; ground claims in fresh screenshot or accessibility evidence.
{% endif %}
{% if not ("browser" in tools) or not ("computer" in tools and computer) %}
- No suitable runtime tool for a changed surface → use a behavioral smoke test and explicitly report that visual verification was unavailable.
{% endif %}
