//! Structured harness notices attached to a tool call (ADR 0008, 0009).

//! A [`Diag`] is protocol data on the call element: the fold materializes it
//! as a `<diag>` child, the model projection renders every diag as one
//! uniform trailing part, and cards present it beside the result. Tools

//! extension tools emit the same JSON envelope (`{"diag": {…}}`) as an update.
